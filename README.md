# Using Microsoft Azure Entity Linking Cognitive API


## Microsoft Entity Linking Intelligence Service API
This API is part of the broader set of APIs provided as part of Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs. This API is designed to help developers with tasks related to Entity Linking. One of the challenges while working with Natural Language Processing is recognizing the context of a particular word within a paragraph/sentence, a word might be used differently in different contexts. For example, in the case where “times” is a named entity, it still may refer to two separately distinguishable entities, such as “The New York Times” or “Times Square”. Given a specific paragraph the Entity Linking Intelligence Service will recognize and identify each separate entity based on its context.
